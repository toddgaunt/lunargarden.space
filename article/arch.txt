The ideal machine architecture is memory-to-memory. This would require huge
instructions however, 64 bits per memory address. This is why register machines
exist, to reduce the number of bits by an instruction. Stack machines do this
further, but in a very different way. Rather than limiting the amount of memory
to randomly access, it creates a stack out of what would normally be the register
space. This is simply less powerful than a random access register space.
